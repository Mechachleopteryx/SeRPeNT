**Tool** : profiles

**Summary** : ncRNA discovery and profiling from small RNA-Seq data

**Usage** :

  srnap profiles [OPTIONS] replicate_1.bam ... replicate_n.bam output_folder

**Options**  :

           -f   Read filtering
                Format is <minreadlen>, where:
                  - <minreadlen> is the minimum required length for the reads. Reads shorter than <readlen> are discarded. If 0, no reads are discarded. Must be >= 0.
                [ Default is 0 ]

           -i   Irreproducibility control for contigs
                Format is <method:cutoff> | <common> | <none>, where:
                  - <method> is the irreproducibility control method. Options are:
                    - sere : Single-parameter quality control. (Schulze et al. BMC Genomics 2012)
                    - idr  : Non-parametric irreproducibility discovery rate. (Dobin et al. Bioinformatics 2013)
                  - <cutoff> is the cutoff value. Contigs that have an irreproducibility score higher than <cutoff> are not reported. Must be > 0.
                  - <common> : Contigs that do not overlap in all the replicates are not reported.
                  - <none>   : All contigs are reported.
                [ Default is common ]

           -r   Replicates treatment
                Format is <pool> | <mean> | <replicate:repnumber>, where:
                  - <pool> : Profiles are built by pooling the reads of all the replicates.
                  - <mean> : Profiles are built by averaging the reads of all the replicates.
                  - <replicate:repnumber> : Profiles are built by using only the reads of the <repnumber> replicate.
                [ Default is pool ]

           -t   Trimming
                Format is <trim_threshold:trim_min:trim_max>
                  - <trim_percentage> is the trimming threshold. Nucleotides in the ends of the profile having less than <trim_precentage> percent of reads compared to the
                                      maximum height will be trimmed.
                  - <trim_min> is the trimming minimum height. All nucleotides in both ends of the profile having less than <trim_min> reads will be trimmed.
                  - <trim_max> is the trimming maximum height. No nucleotides in both ends of the profile having more than <trim_max> reads will be trimmed.
                [ Default is 0.1:2:10 ]

           -p   Profile definition
                Format is <minlen:maxlen:spacing:minheight:trimming>, where:
                  - <minlen> is the minimum length of the profile after trimming. Profiles shorter than <minlen> are not reported. Must be > 5.
                  - <maxlen> is the maximum length of the profile after trimming. Profiles longer than <maxlen> are not reported. Must be >= minlen.
                  - <spacing> is the maximum distance between profiles. Profiles separated by <spacing> or less bp are merged into one single profile. Must be >= 0.
                  - <minheight> is the minimum number of piled-up reads. Profiles that have less than <minheight> piled-up reads are not reported. Must be > 0.
                [ Default is 16:200:20:50 ]
